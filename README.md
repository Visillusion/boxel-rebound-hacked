Home page has a Win button which will mark all levels as completed, once pressed.
Press f to toggle on/off infinite jump
Press g to create a checkpoint wherever you are (this is buggy if you press once about to die. restart level if this occurs).
Press h to finish whatever level you are on, regardless of where you are in the level.

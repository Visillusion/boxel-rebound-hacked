A hacked boxel rebound extension

Home page has a Win button which will mark all levels as completed, once pressed.

Press f to toggle on/off infinite jump

Press g to create a checkpoint wherever you are (this is buggy if you press once about to die. restart level if this occurs).

Press h to finish whatever level you are on, regardless of where you are in the level.

To install this extension, go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode. Then extract the zip archive and upload the folder boxel-rebound-hacked thatis created onto the extensions page. Enjoy!
